### **Maker Comments**

Hey ProductHunt! üëã

I'm excited to launch MomentumX Dashboard - a self-mastery platform that's been 6 months in the making.

**The Problem:**
Most habit trackers are generic and don't address the specific needs of recovery communities, faith-based users, and those seeking deep personal transformation.

**The Solution:**
A comprehensive platform that combines habit tracking with spiritual growth, coach integration, and advanced analytics - all wrapped in a beautiful, modern interface.

**What's Unique:**
‚Ä¢ Faith-based and recovery-focused features
‚Ä¢ Professional coach integration with secure sharing
‚Ä¢ Advanced analytics with personalized insights
‚Ä¢ Data ownership and transparency
‚Ä¢ PWA support for native app experience

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Gumroad integration

**Pricing:**
‚Ä¢ Starter: Free (basic habit tracking)
‚Ä¢ Coach: $9/month (analytics, export, notifications)
‚Ä¢ Business: $19/month (coach sharing, team features)

I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions! What features would you like to see next?
